SETTING UP A DEDICATED DIABLO FEEDER TO WORK WITH
ONE OR MORE DIABLO READER BOXES, WHERE EACH READER
RUNS ITS OWN MINI-FEEDER.

PART 1 - DEDICATED FEEDER CONFIGURATION
=======================================

Current Setup:  One dedicated peering feeder, with 40 peers.
(Diablo 2.2-REL, FreeBSD 3.4-REL, 1024 MB RAM, 27 GB system
disk, 27 GB dedicated spool disk, both 7200 RPM EIDE ATA/66).
System is ranked #82 on the May 2000 Usenet Top 1000.

Goal:  To set up a series of "dedicated" reader machines, each
fed by the peering feeder.  One reader will be assigned binary
groups, the other reader non-binary groups.  Each reader will
have a local 300 GB spool, consisting of four IBM 75 GB EIDE
ATA/66 7200 RPM drives, in a ccd configuration.  Each reader
also has a 9 GB SCSI boot disk, that holds /news/dqueue.

Because this configuration _may_ expand in the future, I have
chosen to do article mastering (xref generation) on the peering
feeder machine.  By doing mastering at the earliest possible
point, Russell Vincent <rv @ openusenet.org> pointed out to me
that it eliminates complexity when adding additional machines.
If you're running only one reader, you don't need to do this.

Some clarification is in order... when I say "reader" machine,
I'm implying a "reader" that's running it's own "feeder" so it
can receive articles from my main "peering feeder" and store
those "realtime" articles in its (the reader's) huge spool.

Further clarification... the purpose of my dedicated peering
feeder (as I'll call it) is to act as a news article router
for the outside world (and to my internal readers).  It does
not maintain a huge article spool.  In fact, most exchanges
(in dnntpspool.ctl) are set to "realtime."  Some aren't, how-
ever, to ensure a propagation path for all articles even when
there's a connectivity glitch on the net (BGP route flaps, or
my tripping over our ethernet).  Much to the chagrin of some
developers, most of our dnewsfeeds entries are set to "rtflush."
This isn't wise or necessary, unless you want to try your hand
at competing in the "mine's bigger than yours" arena.

Let's begin... here's how I've configured the dedicated feeder:

[ /news/diablo.config ]
version 1.20
(path statements were fine)
expire feeder
hash crc
hsize 8m
active on
activedrop off
slave off
maxconnect 15
remember 3
hostcacherebuildtime 3600
displayadminversion on
precommittime 30

[ /news/diablo.hosts ]
In addition to the external peering hosts, I've had to specify
my reader machine so its (my reader's feeder) can post articles
back into the peering feeder for distribution to the world:
# news.via.net - Main reader machine
# Lew Payne <newsadmin @ via.net>
#
209.81.9.56                     vianet
news.via.net                    vianet

[ /news/dnewsfeeds ]
Here are some worthwhile things I've implemented in this file.
For major (busy) peers, I split my outgoing feed to them into
two streams.  I've found this to give me a much better article
acceptance rate than mixing large binaries with small articles
in one stream.  Here are the definitions...

groupdef        SMALL
  maxcross      12
  maxsize       8k
end

groupdef        LARGE
  maxcross      12
  minsize       8k
end

As I said, major peers now get fed two streams.  In addition,
I periodically scan their headers and remove close neighboring
peers, thus again boosting their article acceptance rate...

label megawidgets
  # Don't feed them their own articles, dummy
  alias         bignews.megawidgets.net
  # Don't bother feeding them fast neighbors
  alias         feed.neighbor.com
  alias         news.nexdoor.com
  # Send them all groups except specified ones
  addgroup      *
  delgroupany   alt.svens*
  delgroupany   alt.diablo.*
  delgroupany   rec.humor.flame*
  # This is our small article feed
  groupref      SMALL
  rtflush
end

label megawidgets-2
  # Don't feed them their own articles, dummy
  alias         bignews.megawidgets.net
  # Don't bother feeding them their neighbors
  alias         feed.neighbor.com
  alias         news.nexdoor.com
  # Send them all groups except specified ones
  addgroup      *
  delgroupany   alt.svens*
  delgroupany   alt.diablo.*
  delgroupany   rec.humor.flame*
  # Peer requests 1m file limit
  maxsize       1m
  # This is our large article feed
  groupref      LARGE
  # No need to rtflush the biggies
  # rtflush
end

In addition, I need to allow my local news reader machine to
post articles into the main feeder's stream, for distribution
to the outside world.  Technically, what's happening is my
reader's mini-feeder is posting articles back to my peer feeder...

label vianet
  alias         news.via.net
  addgroup      *
  # No need to rtflush, nobody's going to beat us here!
  #rtflush
end

[ /news/dnntpspool.ctl ]
Now that we've created split feeds in /news/dnewsfeeds, we do
something useful with them here by setting up the links.  The
small articles are given less buffers, and the big articles more.

megaways   feed-in.megawidgets.net 1 nobatch realtime T16384 R8192
megaways-2 feed-in.megawidgets.net 1         realtime T65536 R8192

In addition, we have to provide our internal news reader (with its
own mini-feeder) a feed too, so it can receive and store articles.
It's a local machine, so there's no sense in splitting up the feeds
to it into large and small articles, as we're the only source of
articles for it (on a local LAN, to boot!).  We do, however, allow
our main feeder (not the reader's mini-feeder) to spool up to 12
files (120 minutes worth of articles) for the reader, should it be
down for some reason (which is unlikely).  Since the reader needs
a mini-feeder running on the reader machine, we specify the feeder
port (435), as the default nntp port is for readers.  In addition,
we only allow a maximum of two dnewslinks to catch up articles to
the reader should something delay the feed.

vianet      news.via.net          12 n2 p435 realtime T65536 R8192

[ /etc/rc.local ]
Of course, we want Diablo to start automatically any time
this machine is started (and it should never be stopped)...

#  Get the Diablo feeder running
#
echo "  Starting DIABLO feeder..."
/news/dbin/diablo -p feeder.via.net -h feeder.via.net \
                  -A newsadmin@via.net "-s " -R 16384 server
