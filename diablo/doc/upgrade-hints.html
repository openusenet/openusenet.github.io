<h3>Upgrading from pre2.0 to 2.0</h3>
<b>Newsfeeding</b>
<ul>
<li>Use dprimehostcache to pre-create your host cache file. This allows
    servers to connect immediately.
<li>If you are seeing a large number of rejects for incoming articles
    from a site, use the dnewsfeeds option 'precomreject' to reject
    rather than defer precommit hits for articles from that site. It is
    likely that it does not handle 431 responses gracefully and is
    sending duplicate articles. Older versions of Diablo are some of
    the culprits.
</ul>
<b>Newsreading</b>
<ul>
<li>Authentication is now configured with dreader.access with a
    new format and many more options.
<li>Enable news.debug in syslog to see more verbose logging of exactly
    what commands are being used by a client. This can generate huge
    log files, so its use is not recommended unless you are having
    problems with news client.
</ul>
