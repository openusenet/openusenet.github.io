<hr>
The developers of Diablo encourage bug reports, patches and feature
additions.  Please don't hesitate to report problems to the
diablo-users or diablo-bugs mailing lists. The diablo-users mailing
list has a larger distribution.
<p>
There are 2 main development branches to Diablo. These are the
CURRENT and STABLE branches. The CURRENT (also referred to as
"-current") branch is the main development branch and is where
all major changes and bug fixes are made first. The STABLE (also
referrred to as "-stable") branch is limited to bug fixes on
the latest release code and occasionally minor feature additions
that have been tested in -current.
<p>
If you are submitting a patch or feature addition, please read the
following guidelines:<p>
<ul>
<li>Try and get the patch or addition matching the current programming
    style used in Diablo. Working on code with a consistent style is
    one of the benefits of the current code base.
<li>Submit patches generated with "diff -c" or "diff -u".
<li>Give a good description of your changes and try and update
    the existing documentation as part of the patch.
<li>Try and separate different types or categories of changes into
    different patches.
<li>Try and provide the patches to the latest version of the -current
    code base or the latest -stable code base if it is a minor bug fix
    to that tree.
</ul>
<p>
Daily snapshots of the -current and -stable source trees are available
off the <a href="download/">downloads</a> page. Read-only access to
the CVS repository is also detailed off that page.
<p>
CVS TAGS are provided for each release of Diablo and for the STABLE
branch. The CVS internal HEAD refers to the CURRENT branch.<p>
